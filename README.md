# SupremeSlicer

## Overview

**SupremeSlicer** extends the capabilities of SuperSlicer by integrating advanced features for generating G-code and toolpaths tailored for specialized tools used in the AMPI Machine. The project enhances SuperSlicerâ€™s usability by offering additional functionalities for various tools, enabling more advanced and customized 3D printing operations.

## Features

- **Terminal Client for SuperSlicer (Native Slicer)**:
  - A terminal-based interface for interacting with SuperSlicer, providing advanced control and functionality over the slicing process.

- **G-code Injection per Tool**:
  - **VacuumSuction Tool**: Injects custom G-code to manage vacuum suction operations.
  - **Screwdriver Tool**: Injects custom G-code for screwdriver operations.
  - **Gripper Tool**: Injects custom G-code for gripper operations.

- **G-code Toolpath Viewer Tool**:
  - Visualises overall toolpath or exlusively just the selected tool's toolpath frame by frame.

- **Mesh Animation Render Tool**:
  - Visualises the overall part render as an animation in mesh form.

- **STL Viewer**:
  - Visualises the input STL selected by the user from the config.yaml file
  - Allows the user to add markers to obtain accurate position of the part.
  - User can 'auto-inject' where they wish to use the Screwdriver or the VacuumPnP tool.

## Tools

1. **VacuumSuction Tool**
   - **Description**: Controls a vacuum suction tool during printing.
   - **Features**:
     - Configurable suction state and tool movement parameters.
     - Custom G-code generation for vacuum operations.

2. **Screwdriver Tool**
   - **Description**: Controls a screwdriver tool to inject a part during printing.
   - **Features**:
     - Custom G-code generation for screwdriver actions.
     - Customisable start location with tool movement parameters.

3. **Gripper Tool**
   - **Description**: Controls a gripper tool for handling objects during printing.
   - **Features**:
     - Vibration method for part removal.
     - Adjustable parameters for gripper actions for gripper position/angle.
     - Custom G-code injection for coordinating gripper movements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- SuperSlicer installed and configured
- AMPI Machine with compatible tools

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PralishSatyal/supremeslicer.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd supremeslicer
    ```

3. **Run the Install Script**:
    ```bash
    resources/install.bat
    ```

4. **Run the program**:
- You can run this program as either the python script or as the built exe file that you may have just made.
- If you want to run this as a python script, make sure you're in the parent directory to the main.py file and run:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
- If you want to run this as an application, you can do this through running the exe or pressing the shortcut .lnk file.
    ```bash
    main.exe
    SupremeSlicer.lnk
    ```

### Configuration

- Create or update configuration files for each tool:
  - `vacuum_config.yaml`
  - `screwdriver_config.yaml`
  - `gripper_config.yaml`
  
  Specify the parameters for G-code generation in these files.

- Update the paths in the `configs/config.yaml` file to match your setup.
